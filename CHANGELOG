v3.0.0
* Breaking change: changed Spacer api. Now it has 2 methods: new() and get(). `new` creates a new
  spacer instance as usual require 'spacer'({}) call. `get()` returns a spacer
  instance by its name or a default instance.
* spacer instances can have names now. And they are fully independent in terms of
  migrations and allocated system spaces.

v2.1.1
* Changed behaviour of migrations' versions handling.
* Removed version_name() method. Now version() is returning the full version (<timestamp>_<name>).
* check_alter option for makemigration() function.
* New migrate_dummy() function to imitate migration applying.

v2.0.1
* New version 2 with migrations and stuff
